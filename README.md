Just your average repository

I'm just trying to get a better grasp of GitHub by practising it as much as possible.

Adding more content to this file and using proper labels in 'Opening an Issue' and 'Opening a Pull Request'.
This way, this issue should close automatically after merging the branch.
Here we go again!
